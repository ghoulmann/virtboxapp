MAJOR NOTE
==================================================================
This was built as a learning exercise! There are other TurnKey Linux based tklpatches that do the same 
thing but BETTER. One such example is available at http://9while9.com/


This is a project for building a Turnkey Linux patch to configure a
VirtualBox Linux installation on Debian 6 along with the following additions:

- PHPVirtualBox


DONATIONS
==================================================================
If you want to send donations to keep this work going, please send them to
the authors of VirtualBox and/or PHPVirtualBox.
They are the heroes in this effort, not me.


USAGE
==================================================================
This patch should be applied onto version 12.0 of the 
Turnkey CORE distribution found at:
http://www.turnkeylinux.org/core

This can be done be either installing the core appliance and applying the patch

OR

by patching the installable ISO image of the distribution
